            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Having 16+ years of diverse IT experience, my career began with over 6 years as a Software Developer. I then pursued a Master’s in Information Systems with a focus on Big Data Analytics. During my studies, I interned as a Data Analyst, explored product and program management, leading to over 8 years as a Technical Program Manager. This experience strengthened both my technical and leadership skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few years ago, I developed an interest in cloud technology and began earning certifications, starting with AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals and more recently, AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate. My passion for cloud computing continued to grow, and I recently started studying for AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate. However, I struggled to retain the concepts and was looking for a more hands-on approach in cloud, which led me to the <strong>Cloud Resume Challenge</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about working towards a career as a Cloud Solutions Architect, DevOps, and FinOps professional, with a keen interest in delivering Enterprise AI solutions.

            <article>
                <h3>Chunk 1: Building the Front End</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Static Assets:</strong> I started by creating and customizing the static assets including <code>index.html</code>, <code>styles.css</code>, and <code>scripts.js</code> by leveraging starter templates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>S3 Bucket Setup:</strong> I set up an S3 bucket, uploaded the static assets, enabled static website hosting, and configured public access.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Security Concerns:</strong> I used CloudFront with HTTPS for secure connections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Domain and DNS:</strong> I chose Cloudflare for domain management, setting up CNAME records and enabling DNSSEC.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Challenges:</em> Initial attempts using Azure Storage Accounts and CDN for hosting failed due to domain mapping issues, leading me to switch to AWS.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Chunk 2: Building the API</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>DynamoDB:</strong> Used to store visitor counts, updated through a Lambda function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Monitoring:</strong> Integrated CloudWatch, PagerDuty, and Slack for alert notifications.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Challenges:</em> Issues with Azure CosmosDB and Function Apps prompted another switch to AWS.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Chunk 3: Front-End/Back-End Integration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>JavaScript Updates:</strong> Updated to call the Lambda function URL endpoint for visitor count increment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Testing:</strong> Used Cypress for automated end-to-end testing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Challenges:</em> CORS issues were resolved, but unique visitor tracking using the X-Forwarded-For header proved difficult to implement.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Chunk 4: Automation / CI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Terraform:</strong> Used for Infrastructure as Code, organizing components into separate <code>.tf</code> files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> Automated CI/CD processes, dynamically injecting environment variables into JavaScript files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GPG Integration:</strong> Configured for signing commits to verify authenticity.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Challenges:</em> Attempted OIDC for secure credential management but ultimately used GitHub secrets.</p>

                Completing the Cloud Resume Challenge was transformative. This journey taught me the importance of persistence, hands-on learning, and discipline. I encountered numerous challenges but tackled them one step at a time. I avoided looking at others’ solutions to fully immerse myself in the learning process. Consistency, willpower, and a problem-solving mindset are key to success.
